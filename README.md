The Sail ISA specification language - Coq support library
=========================================================

Overview
========

Sail is a language for describing the instruction-set architecture
(ISA) semantics of processors. Sail aims to provide a
engineer-friendly, vendor-pseudocode-like language for describing
instruction semantics. It is essentially a first-order imperative
language, but with lightweight dependent typing for numeric types and
bitvector lengths, which are automatically checked using Z3. It has
been used for several papers, available from
<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/>.
<p>

This repository contains the Coq support library for models produced
by Sail for the [Coq theorem prover](https://coq.inria.fr/).  The
[main Sail repository](https://github.com/rems-project/sail) contains
the Sail tool for processing Sail specifications and translating them
into Coq.

Installation
============

We suggest using the [opam package manager](https://opam.ocaml.org/)
if you also used it to install Coq.  See [the instructions on using
opam with Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/opam-using.html) for more
information.  The `coq-sail` package depends on the `coq-bbv` package
for its implementation of bitvectors.

It's also possible to build the library locally without opam using the
Makefile in the `src` directory.  You can also change the bitvector
library used by changing the `src/MachineWord.v` symbolic link.

An opam package is also available using the stdpp-unstable bitvector
library.  It changes the Coq library name so that it can be installed
alongside the BBV version, so references to `Sail` in the models
should be replaced by `SailStdpp`.  Sail can do this when generating
Coq output using the arguments `-coq_alt_modules SailStdpp.Base
-coq_alt_modules SailStdpp.Real`.

Licensing
=========

The library has the same licensing terms as the main Sail tool.  These
can be found in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
